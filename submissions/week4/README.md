- The semantic search system performed well overall, especially on factual or clearly defined queries. Finance-related questions would consistently return the relevant and correct answers based on the data provided, showing that the embeddings capture topic-level similarity effectively. Machine learning queries also ranked the relevant transformer and neural network descriptions highly. Vague or multi-topic queries produced more mixed results, sometimes returning documents that matched only part of the query. So in conclusion, the system provides fairly sound answers however it starts to fail when the queries are about a mix of topics.
