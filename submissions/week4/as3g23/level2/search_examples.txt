Findings:
The retrieval system shines when queries map directly to specific facts or clear categories, evidenced by the high confidence scores (>0.60) for "spicy food" and "dough ingredients" where semantic intent aligned perfectly with the documents. It also demonstrated strong abstract reasoning by correctly retrieving specific examples (Jupiter, Saturn) for the generic category "celestial bodies" despite having no keyword overlap. However, the system failed on the query "web development tools," where it prioritized an irrelevant Machine Learning document (Score: 0.284) over the correct React library document. This highlights that while semantic search is powerful, it can struggle to disambiguate between general technical domains when strong semantic anchors are missing or when confidence scores are low.
