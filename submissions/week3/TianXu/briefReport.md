Brief report:
  What did changing parameters do?
    max length - higher length generated longer text and took more time 
    temprature - higher temrature made the outputs more random and lower temprature made the outputs more normal
    top_k - lower value make results word use more predictable and repetative
  
  Which settings produced best results?
    max length = 50
    temprature = 1.0
    top_k = 50
  
  How long did generation take?
    I printed the time it took on the results txt file
