Yannis Lee - Diagnostic Task Submission

LEVEL REACHED: 3 (haven't finished)

LEVEL 1: [Architecture-Exercises/submissions/week3/YannisLee/LEVEL 1.png]

LEVEL 2: [Architecture-Exercises/submissions/week3/YannisLee/Submission_code.py]

The generation time task was fine, however the generation token task confuses me at first. After knowing the existence of Autotokonizer library and understanding how the library and it's prebuild functions works, I successfully counted the total generized token. 
         
LEVEL 3: [Option: A]
[Architecture-Exercises/submissions/week3/YannisLee/Submission_code.py]
I did two broken models for task A. The first broken model will repeat itself endlessly, I did it through adding a while loop that loops towards infinity. The second broken model will generate nonsense/gibberish, I did it by changing top_k value and adding a reprtition penalty value. I found it ok doing the two models. 

TIME SPENT: 6 hours 

WHAT I FOUND EASY: code in LEVEL 3 and LEVEL 2 - time generation
WHAT I FOUND HARD: LEVEL 1 - there's a problem in my laptop and I couldn't run the diagnostic_task.py, I struggled on trying to fix it. Code in LEVEL 2 - counting tokens
