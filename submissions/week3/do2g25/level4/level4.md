# What It is

My project is an app which can detect my face. It will "scan" a video feed in realtime to detect faces, and if a face is found it will decide if that face belongs to me or not. If it gets a certain number of positive matches in a row it will "authorise" the user (basically a Face ID system).

# Why I chose it

Seemed cool to me
