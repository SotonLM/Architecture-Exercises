I could not make the system work on my computer within the time limit, so 
I had to complete the tasks on the school computers, therfore I did not have
time for level 4. 

Therefore, instead I will reference 2 projects I have already made.

If that is not acceptable you can just mark my level 4 as not completed.


They are both available on: https://alimuratkeceli.com with links to demo and github


Project 1: Stock price predictor with LSTM, using PyTorch (No demo)
https://github.com/AliMKCL/Stock-Price-Predictor

Stack:
- PyTorch
- Google Colab

What I learned:
- Automatic hyperparameter tuning (With Optuna library)
- Dealing with data leaks and overfitting/underfitting
- Handling unpredictable time-series data

What I could improve next:
- Trying different algorithms (random forests, XGBoost...)



Project 2: Reddit + RAG based Zelda gaming advisor (Crappy video demo)
https://github.com/AliMKCL/Links-Internet

What I learned:
- RAG
- Prompting
- Web scraping (reddit specific, with PRAW library)

Stack:
- FastAPI
- ChromaDB
- OpenAI

what I could improve next:
- Find more sources and scraping material online 
(Reddit has very little content for older zelda games so I limited to 2 games)
