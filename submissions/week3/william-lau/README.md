Subject: [William Lau] - Diagnostic Task Submission

LEVEL REACHED: [1/2/3/4]

- NOTE I WROTE ALL MY CODE IN THE SAME FILE CALLED submission.py and put each task under a function i.e. level1Task, level2Task and level3Task

LEVEL 1: ✅ [<img width="2518" height="1340" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3e8f845-6183-4808-8876-19016fc070b1" />

LEVEL 2: ✅ [https://github.com/lauw-07/Architecture-Exercises/blob/main/submissions/week3/william-lau/submission.py] [https://github.com/lauw-07/Architecture-Exercises/blob/main/submissions/week3/william-lau/result.txt]
- Brief summary of findings
  - What did changing parameters do?
  Changing the parameters from (20, 0.5, 10) for max_length, temperature and top_k to (100, 1.5, 100) has made the output generated by the AI both longer and deeper in the sense that the vocabulary used was broader.
  - Which settings produced best results?
  It would be (100, 1.5, 100) for max_length, temperature and top_k
  - How long did generation take?
  The time taken to generate the outputs varied depending on the different parameters. Sometimes it was as quick as 0.2 seconds and other times for larger outputs, it took aroudn 3 to 4 seconds to generate one output.

LEVEL 3: ✅ [Option A/B/C/D]
- [https://github.com/lauw-07/Architecture-Exercises/blob/main/submissions/week3/william-lau/submission.py]
- I did option B. In order to do so, i made up my own scoring algorithm (pretty straightforward) based on length of the generated output, the amount of repitition of words, the punctuation used and the relevance towards the prompts. I then scaled them so that i will get a score out of 100, with 100 being the best score. Honestly, i don't think this scoring method is the most effective but it is a simple start. And then i just wrote some code similar to that in level 2 so that it loops through the prompts and goes through each of the params settings and then calculates the score for each and puts it into a txt file called level3-results.txt (Attached to the folder aswell)

LEVEL 4: ✅ [If completed]
- Project name: ___
- What it does: ___
- [Demo link]

TIME SPENT: 2-3 hours (Mainly because I was figuring out how to set up the project on my laptop)

WHAT I FOUND EASY: Most of it was pretty straightfoward
WHAT I FOUND HARD: Since i haven't had any experience with using AI models and transformers, I wasn't completely aware of all the existing functions etc. But the actual coding i did was pretty straightforward. Although i didn't get around to attempting all the other options from Level 3
QUESTIONS: ___
```
