- Brief summary of findings
  - What did changing parameters do?
  Changing the parameters from (20, 0.5, 10) for max_length, temperature and top_k to (100, 1.5, 100) has made the output generated by the AI both longer and deeper in the sense that the vocabulary used was broader.
  - Which settings produced best results?
  It would be (100, 1.5, 100) for max_length, temperature and top_k
  - How long did generation take?
  The time taken to generate the outputs varied depending on the different parameters. Sometimes it was as quick as 0.2 seconds and other times for larger outputs, it took aroudn 3 to 4 seconds to generate one output.
