- Brief summary of findings:

Changing the generation parameters clearly affected the model’s output.
Shorter max_length produced concise but sometimes incomplete text, while very long outputs (100 tokens) caused more repetition. Temperature had the biggest impact: low values (0.5) made the text predictable and repetitive, while high values (1.5) made it much more random and less coherent. top_k controlled diversity—higher values increased creativity but also introduced more nonsense.

Overall, the most balanced results came from max_length = 50, temperature = 1.0, and top_k = 50.

Generation time per sample was around 1–3 seconds, depending mostly on max_length.
