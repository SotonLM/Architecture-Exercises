Populated corpus.txt with the first section from wikipedia for Paris, sushi, einstein and the moon. I removed the [] refrences from the file because it was breaking the formatting.
Saved embeddings in corpus_embeddings.npy

Search queries returned good results when the cosine similarity is >=0.65.

For the question about where is the eiffel tower, it correctly identified an association with paris, but given that the corpus does not contain a phrase like "the eiffel tower is in paris", the results feel very disjointed from the query.
