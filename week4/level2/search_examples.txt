ANALYSIS:

Retrieval shines when:
- queries directly match specific document topics, as seen with "python programming" and "basketball" where the top results had high similarity scores and clear relevance

Retrievals fail when:
- dealing with multi-topic queries like "technology impact on sports training," where no single document bridges both topics, resulting in generic sports content without technological context
- vague queries that require inferring user intent beyond literal meaning, as "cooking for beginners" returned advanced techniques rather than fundamental instruction

Overall, the system excels at direct semantic matching but lacks the contextual understanding needed for complex queries
