Retrievals shine most when the wording and words in the query used are the same as in the corpus databank, but it seems like related queries still seem to work, the last one though is a bit of an exception
the results for the last query are interesting in the way that there is no mention of the apollo sentence in the top 3, it seems to focus very much on the first half of the sentence in this case, so the scope of questions probably can't be too large. with smaller models
