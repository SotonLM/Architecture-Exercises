Reflection:
There are many good and bad retrivals, for example a good one would be the first query about the nutritional value 
of apples had the first ranking snippit for apples being the only one speaking specifically about nutritional value 
of apples. But the similarity score is lower than I expected since the snippit is only taking about nutrition.
The vague prompt about museums was quite bad as the first ranking response is about running wich doesn't 
really corelate. This shows that the retrivals are better for more detailed querys.
