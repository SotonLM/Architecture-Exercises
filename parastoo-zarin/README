# Week 3 Level 2 Submission

**Name:** Parastoo Zarin  
**Date:** Nov 22 2025  

## What I submitted:
- level2.py - my code
- results.txt - the outputs from running it
- REPORT.txt - my observations

## Requirements completed:

I did all the stuff:
- Saved outputs to file (check results.txt)
- Tested 5 prompts 
- Tried different max_lengths (20, 50, 100)
- Tried different temperatures (0.5, 1.0, 1.5)
- Tried different top_k values (10, 50, 100)
- Timed everything
- Counted tokens

## What I found out

**max_length:**
- 20 was too short, cuts off sentences
- 50 seemed like the sweet spot
- 100 took longer and sometimes got repetitive

**temperature:**
- 0.5 was kinda boring, very safe outputs
- 1.0 was pretty good
- 1.5 got creative but weird sometimes

**top_k:**
- 10 kept using same words over and over
- 50 was good balance
- 100 had more variety but sometimes random words

## Best settings I found:
max_length=50, temperature=1.0, top_k=50

These gave the best results without being too slow or too random.

## Timing
Average time was around 0.5 seconds per prompt which is pretty fast. Total for all 5 prompts was about 2.5 seconds.

## What I learned
- how different parameters change the output
- higher numbers dont always = better results
- timing code is important for performance
- the model loads slow first time then faster after

Ready for tier 2!
